## Debugging Robot

Debug functionality is unique way of checking what is happening during tests
execution. It works similar as debug functionality in most of programming
languages - it allows to track execution of a program for checking unwanted
behavior either on tests side or in tested software.

Warning

    Avoid making changes in scripts/suites when debugging as you may encounter problems with finding proper code elements to suspend on. 

Note

    Step-into works only for Robot written Keywords. If you wish to step-into Python Keywords, check [Debug Robot and Python scripts](debug/robot_python_debug.md) help content. 

### Basics

In order to work with debugger please save any unsaved files beforehand.
Debugging is done inside **Debug** perspective however you don't need to
activate it as by default RED will ask if you want to activate it once the
tests execution suspends. The same is true for editors: debugger will open an
editor with currently executing file when suspended.

Execution may be suspended due to couple of reasons:

  * **user requested suspend** \- this is done by pressing **Suspend** button as described in [Controlling execution topic](exec_control.md), 

  * **breakpoint hit** \- whenever [breakpoint](debug/breakpoints.md) (a place in code) defined by the user have been hit, 

  * **erroneous state suspension** \- debugger may go into erroneous state. This may happen when running tests locally (for example when test uses unknown keyword) however it is more probable in remote execution when local code does not exactly match remote code. By default RED will ask if execution should suspend but this behavior is configurable in [preferences](debug/preferences.md), 

  * **end of step** \- when suspended due to one of reasons above user may ask debugger to perform a step (e.g. step over current keyword call), such step will result in another suspension just after current instruction. 

For more information about suspending execution and working with it please
refer to [ Suspended execution](debug/hitting_a_breakpoint.md) topic.

### Starting debugging session

#### Place breakpoint in RobotFramework executable code

First thing when working with debugger is to place at least one breakpoint.
This allows RED to pause the execution and activate stepping options. You may
add breakpoint inside the editor at **Source** page either by double clicking
on left-side ruler, choosing **Toggle breakpoint** option from context menu of
this ruler or by hitting ` Ctrl`+`Shift`+`B` shortcut (this will add
breakpoint for the line in which the caret is located). When successful, blue
ball icon will appear next to it and new breakpoint entry will be visible in
Breakpoint view.

#### Start Debug

To start debugging you need to [launch](ui_elements.md) the configuration in
debug mode. For example by clicking on "green bug" icon at the top toolbar:

#### Limiting test cases to be debugged

You may edit the launch configuration in order to limit test cases which
should be executed in your debug session. Open [ Run -> Debug
Configurations...](javascript:executeCommand\('org.eclipse.debug.ui.commands.OpenDebugConfigurations'\))
dialog and choose which cases should be executed:
